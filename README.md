# FindAnagrams
This is an application to look for anagrams in a dictionary file. This app uses a HashMap with a lowercase sorted string for each word as the key. Therefore, a set of anagram matches can be found for a particular word quickly by using the hash key. Also, the hash table can be searched to get sets of anagrams of a particular count.
